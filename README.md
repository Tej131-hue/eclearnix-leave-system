🏢 ECLEARNIX Smart Leave Request System

A lightweight, real-time **internal leave management system** built as a contribution project during my internship at **ECLEARNIX**.  
This system digitizes the traditional leave request workflow, making employee leave submission and managerial approval fast, transparent, and paperless

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Employee submits a leave request  
2. Request is stored in Firebase Realtime Database  
3. Manager portal instantly displays new requests  
4. Manager approves/rejects  
5. Employee sees live status update
